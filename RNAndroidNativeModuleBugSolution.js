To solve this, you need to carefully check the third-party library's documentation for Android-specific setup instructions.  This might involve:

1. **Adding necessary dependencies:** Include the correct module dependency in your app's `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. **Linking native libraries:** Make sure all necessary native libraries (`.so` files) are included in the correct locations within the Android project.
3. **Configuring build settings:** Verify that the build settings are correctly configured to include and link the native module. This might involve updating `build.gradle` with the appropriate settings for native libraries or dependencies. 
4. **Cleaning and rebuilding:** After making any changes, always clean and rebuild your Android project to ensure the changes take effect. Run `./gradlew clean` and then rebuild your app.

If using React Native's autolinking feature, make sure the library is correctly registered in your `package.json`.  If autolinking fails, manual linking steps might be required. Consult the third-party library's documentation for specific steps.
